                  "Circulation is one of those things you probably never think about, even though it's crucial for good health. Your heart pumps about 5 quarts of blood throughout your body's system of blood vessels each minute. When your circulatory system is working well, it delivers oxygen throughout the body and helps to eliminate waste. When circulation is poor, your blood doesn't flow as vigorously—and symptoms can include numbness in your fingers and toes, fluid retention, bloating, and a lack of energy.The good news is that if you are dealing with poor circulation, one of the easiest ways to get your blood pumping optimally again is by exercising. \"When the heart muscle contracts at a higher rate, the blood moves more rapidly through the blood vessels, which improves circulation,\" says Jeff Martin, a chiropractor and personal trainer in Houston, Texas. James Shapiro, a personal trainer in New York City agrees, adding that both cardiovascular and resistance training are important if you want to improve circulation. (Got 10 minutes?

Hold both ends of the bands and step a foot or so away from the anchor, then squat down with your arms fully extended.
